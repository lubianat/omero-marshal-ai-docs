OMERO Marshal Documentation
===========================

Guides for people who need to turn OMERO model objects into portable,
JSON-friendly dictionaries and back again. The notes below focus on how the
codecs work, what gets included, and how to extend them safely.

.. warning::
   This is an **unofficial, AI-generated companion** to the upstream
   `omero-marshal <https://github.com/ome/omero-marshal>`_ project. Always
   validate behaviour against the upstream code and tests before relying on
   these docs in production.

.. note::
   Jargon is linked to the :doc:`glossary` the first time it appears (for
   example :term:`Marshalling` or :term:`Codec`) so you can jump straight to
   definitions without losing your place.

.. note::
   Need an offline copy? Read the Docs builds publish full-site downloads
   (PDF, EPUB, and HTML zip) from the **Downloads** menu; grab those for
   complete docs in one go.
